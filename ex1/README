# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation

## Player Strategies
### 1. WhateverPlayer
- **Strategy**: Pure randomization
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Always makes completely random moves
  - Selects any available empty cell with equal probability
  - No strategic decision-making involved

### 2. CleverPlayer
- **Strategy**: Offensive-focused with randomization element
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses a hybrid approach:
    - 70% chance of making a strategic move
    - 30% chance of making a random move
  - Strategic moves focus on:
    - Creating the longest possible streak of own marks
    - Evaluating vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines
    - Maximizing offensive opportunities
  - Notably does NOT consider opponent's threats

### 3. GeniusPlayer
- **Strategy**: Balanced offensive and defensive approach
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Always attempts strategic moves first
  - Falls back to random moves only when no strategic options exist
  - Strategic moves consider:
    - Potential streaks for own marks
    - Potential streaks for opponent's marks
    - Takes maximum value between offensive and defensive opportunities
  - Complete analysis in all directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal)

  | Streak Evaluation     | No             | Yes          | Yes          |

## Object-Oriented Design Benefits

## 1. Abstraction and Information Hiding
- Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features
- The board hides 1D/2D conversion details behind intuitive coordinate-based access.
- Player implementations abstract away the strategy logic.
- Game engine abstracts away the player interactions.


### 2. Encapsulation and Maintainability
- Player implementations encapsulate strategy logic and decision-making.
- Each player class has a single responsibility
- Easy to update or fix individual player implementations
- Players can be developed and tested independently.
- New players can be added without modifying existing code.


## 3. Polymorphism
- Different player types (Human, Whatever, clever, Genius) operate through the same Player interface.
- Player implementations can be swapped without affecting the game logic.


### 4. Extensibility
- Simple to add new player with different strategic methods by implementing the Player interface
- Can enhance existing players without affecting other parts of the system


### 5. Testability
- Player implementations can be tested in isolation
- Easy to create mock players for testing game logic
- Simple to compare different player strategies
- Random behavior can be controlled for testing
